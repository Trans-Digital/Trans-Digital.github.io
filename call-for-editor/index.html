<h3 class="computer_text">Call for Editor</h3>

<br>

<p>We are seeking a third team member to help in the editing process with a publication goal of Spring 2016. The team currently consists of two transmasculine editors after the departure of a third editor. We are seeking a transfeminine addition, preferably with editing experience, and an interest in how trans lives intersect with the Internet. <a href="./CallForEditor-Trans_Anthology.pdf"><span style="color:#0F3;">Read full details here</span></a>.</p>
